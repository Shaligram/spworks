README

io_drv is a light kernel loadable module which creates tap interfaces which can be used to send network traffic. 
By default this module creates four number of interfaces with name: myif-0, myif-1, myif-2, myif-3. 
This utility consists of files: io_drv.c, Makefile, io_drv.ko (Kernel module after compilation)

Steps to create interface using id_driver
1. Compilation: To compile, use command 'make' which will generate io_drv.ko
2. Loading kernel module to create interfaces (requires super user rights): 
    insmod io_drv.ko
3. Unloading io_drv modile to remove interfaces (requires super user rights) : 
    rmmod io_drv

If you want custom names and number of interfaces, IF_NAME and NUM_OF_IFACE macros can be modified accordingly in file io_drv.c
