Adding proxy in Linux http://blog.rahuljain.org/2012/05/how-to-set-proxy-in-ubuntu-terminal.html

If you are under a proxy server, and want to access net using http or ftp through Terminal,you will need to export http_proxy/ftp_proxy variables. 
 For a HTTP proxy, simply run the following command in a terminal
 export http_proxy='http://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port " 
For a HTTPs and FTP  
 export https_proxy=https://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port 
 export ftp_proxy=ftp://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port   
If there is no username and password required for your proxy then simply remove the username and password section. 

" export https_proxy=https://proxy_ip:port "
These settings are saved into  /etc/apt/apt.conf file .So you can directly add these variables using text editor .First open the apt.conf file
" sudo gedit /etc/apt/apt.conf "
then enter the username,password,proxy_ip and port in given format
 Acquire::http::proxy "http://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port ";
 Acquire::https::proxy "https://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port" ;
 Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp://proxy_username:password@proxy_ip:port ";
